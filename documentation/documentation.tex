\section{Recurrence Relations/Dynamic Programming}
\subsection{Bell numbers}
The Bell numbers represent the number of ways to count partitions of (or equivalently equivalence relations on) an $n$ element set. The $n$-th bell number is given by the recurrence
\[B_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} {n-1 \choose k-1} B_{n-k}\]
for $n \ge 0$.
\subsection{Catalan numbers}
The Catalan numbers form a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively-defined objects. They can be expressed by the recurrence relation
\[C_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n}C_iC_{n-1}\]
for $n \ge 0$.

\noindent Their closed form is given by
\[{2n \choose n} - {2n \choose n+1 }\]
\subsection{Fibonacci numbers}
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted $F_n$, form a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, with $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$, and the recurrence given by
\[F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\]
for $n > 1$.

\subsection{Stirling numbers of the second kind}

\section{Permutations and Combinations}
\subsection{n choose k}
\subsection{n pick k}
\subsection{n choose k, repetition allowed}
\subsection{n pick k, repetition allowed}
\subsection{Generate permutations of a string}
\subsection{Generate all bit strings of length n}

\section{Relations}
\subsection{\# of relations}
\subsection{\# of transitive relations}
There is no known closed formula for counting the number of transitive relations. The (perhaps inefficient) approach taken in this algorithm is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] Generate all possible relations for an $n$ element set (given by the power set of the cartesian product of the set $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$)
\item[(2)] For each relation generated in (1), check that for each $(a,b)$, if there is a point of the form $(b,c)$, then $(a,c)$ must be in the relation
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{\# of (ir)reflexive relations}
\subsection{\# of symmetric relations}
\subsection{\# of antisymmetric relations}
\subsection{\# of equivalence relations}

\section{Sets}
\subsection{Generate power set}
\subsection{Generate cartesian product}

\section{Isomorphisms}
maybe total orders?
