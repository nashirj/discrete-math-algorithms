[x] Bell numbers
[x] Catalan numbers
[ ] Fibonacci sequence
[ ] Stirling numbers of the first kind
[ ] Stirling numbers of the second kind


### Permutations and Combinations
[ ] N choose k
[ ] N pick k
[ ] Permutations with repetition
[ ] Combinations with repetition
[ ] Generate all bit strings of length n
[ ] Generate all alphabetic strings of length n


### Counting
[ ] Number of relations
[ ] Number of reflexive relations
[ ] Number of symmetric relations
[ ] Number of antisymmetric relations
[ ] Number of transitive relations
[ ] Number of s_0 avoidant strings of length n
[ ] Number of s_0 inclusive strings of length n


### Misc
[ ] Automatically solve recurrence relations with constant coefficients
